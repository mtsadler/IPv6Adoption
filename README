EXPLORING THE REALM OF IPV6
Project Proposal by Shreya Sharma & Michael Sadler


As internet and related technologies increase in size everyday, our archaic allocation of ip addresses through IPv4 addressing scheme becomes more obsolete and difficult to handle everyday. We have long exhausted our address space using IPv4 scheme and are delaying havocs by using NATs and CIDR. There is no debate on the fact that at the time IPV4 was introduced it was a genuinely good way of IP allocation given the number of PCs, active users and world population at that time. But we have come a long way ever since. During the deployment of IPV4 addresses in 1989 the world population was around 4 billion, and the addressing scheme provided 232 addresses which could virtually supply one IP address to every person on the planet. It must be noted that this was just the dawn of internet and the kind of usage we have today, with every person (atleast in developed countries) owning more than one internet connected devices (be it laptop, cell phone, tablets etc) was an inconceivable idea. Naturally at that time, IPV4 seemed more than enough. But today in the year 2017, the world population has almost doubled, reaching 7.5 billion in April. That is double the amount of address space in IPv4, with the constraint that each person gets just one IP address and ignoring the fact that there are a lot of reserved and private IP addresses in the pool too. But somehow we have managed to stretch the IPv4 life, using NATs. The basic idea behind NAT is rather simple, it just has internal and external network addresses. External addresses can be globally recognizable whereas internal addresses need to be unique only within a network, meaning that several devices can be allocation same internal IP addresses as long as they are part of different globally identifiable networks. But even with this novel scheme of over utilizing the current IPv4 space, we will not be able to keep up the supply and demand chain in control for long. With the imminent arrival of Internet of Things, matters are bound to get worse. But we do have a solution sitting right under the rack for almost 20 years now- IPv6.

IPv6 basic protocol, also known as RFC 2460 was first published in 1998 with the introduction of a 128 bit addressing scheme (as opposed to its predecessor’s 32 bit addressing scheme). It provides 2128 or 340 undecillion addresses, clearly more than enough for the entire human race carrying several ipconfig devices. At the first stance, IPv6 clearly looks like the immediate, effective and long lasting solution to the IP address crisis and it should be implemented in the earliest possible manner. However, the growth of IPV6 adress over the internet has seen a much staggering pace.  The main obstacle is the hourglass structure of the OSI model with IPv4 acting s the biggest constraint at its waist. Deployment of IPv6 has been increasingly slow because of the economic overhead the transfer holds. Currently all the elements of our network have the ability to handle IPv4 adresses and the cost of transferring them all to IPv6 is really high. Clearly, the key business players do not want to invest immediately in IPv6, atleast till the point of absolute emergency. There is no pressure from the end user side either as the very deployment of IPv6 has long been planned as a silent transition with efforts to minimize any effects the end user may feel.

Inspite of this crippled growth, but a lot of ISPs already have support for IPv6 and most devices today come equipped with a MAC derives IPv6 address, but inspite of these inbuilt capabilities in modern devices, very few of actual packet transmissions happen in IPv4. The growth is measureable but not fast enough. In a time when the deployment of IPv6 is going to become a necessity rather than an option very soon, it is a good idea to actually check how far we have come in  the deployment of IPv6 and what are the trends in this deployment. This brings us to the title of our project, ‘exploring the realm of IPv6’. The approach we have chosen is highly guided by the previous research in the field. The aim of the project is simple. We intend to see the outreach of IPV6 over different servers, networks and countries. We intend to accomplish our goals in three main steps. First we take the top twenty most visited websites of the world and then we choose twenty countries in a geographically spread out manner (picking a few countries from every region of the world). Finally we measure the performance of IPv4 vs IPv6 by sending request from a host in each of the chosen countries to the server of each of the chosen websites. The performance will be measured on two main parameters- time taken to return a response and number of hops in each version’s route. The choice of these particular parameters has been based on previous research work and the simplicity of comparison. The time taken to return a response can be a direct indicator of how many devices on the way were actually su[pportive of IPv6 as compared to IPv4. The number of hops in the route will be a good indicator of the extend of deployment of IPv6 routing tables and their outreach.

The approach and idea of this project has been backed up by many previous research works. In his dissertation [1] in 2016, John B. Southworth, has explored the deployment of IPv6 in 1000 colleges and universities of the United States. After careful research work, his stance has been very clear; institutions that are readily deploying IPv6 proactively are saving themselves of an impending rush hour cost of immediate IPv6 deployment at an emergency state. In another work [2], Jakub Czyz et. Al., measure IPv6 adoption rate and they have discovered important trends. For instance, while roughly 36% of new monthly (and 12% of cumulative) allocated prefixes are IPv6, we find just 0.63% of average traffic is carried over IPv6—a two-order-of-magnitude difference [2]. Clearly the problem lies in the network itself and not the end hosts, that drives us in our project to measure the network directly. As discussed in [3], the performance measures that we use (time to return a response and number of hops in the route) are reliable measures of network adaptability. In [3], authors discuss the methods of traceroute that we intend to use in our project and provide a backbone of their reliability. In [4], authors discuss their experience in using ATLAS Ripe platform for probing servers through different hosts over the world. The authors have vouched for the platform’s unbiased data outcomes and its ability to provide a large array of host choices through largely dispensed probes. Clearly, it will serve as a good starting point for our project too.
